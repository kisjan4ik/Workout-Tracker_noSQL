  ## Installation

  To correctly use this project you needed to install:
  npm i express, npm i mongoose and npm i morgan.

  ## Usage

  A user is able to view create and track daily workouts with this application. It has an option to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. It also gives a possibility to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the application tracks the distance traveled.
